# micro-dice
Dice set emulator for the micro:bit system

Select the dice you want to use with the buttons and throw it by shaking the micro:bit!

Written in MicroPython

You can flash the code into the micro:bit in many ways. I used the terminal application uflash for linux, available for install through pip:

pip3 intall uflash

Then, plug in the micro:bit and flash the code with the command:

uflash dice.py
